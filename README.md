# FARYO Framework

**Federated Agile with AI-native Operating System**

FARYO is a next-generation organizational framework designed for companies that want to be fast, adaptive, and AI-native. It empowers autonomous teams, integrates AI as a colleague, and aligns work through principle-driven governance.

---

## üåü What Is FARYO?

FARYO stands for **Federated Agile Roles & Operating System**. It‚Äôs a framework that enables organizations to:

- Operate with **federated teams** that choose their own delivery styles (Scrum, Kanban, Prince2, etc.)
- Collaborate with **AI as a direct colleague**, not just a tool
- Align through **shared principles**, not rigid processes
- Adapt quickly to **market changes and product innovation**

## üîç Key Concepts

- **Federated Teams**: Autonomous units organized around outcomes, not departments.
- **AI-Native Collaboration**: AI supports decision-making, diagnostics, and learning.
- **Empiricism at Scale**: Decisions are based on observed reality, not assumptions.
- **Principle-Driven Governance**: Lightweight, outcome-based coordination.
