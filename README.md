## üåü  What Is YottaDots?

YottaDots stands for **Federated AI-native Operating System for Society**. It‚Äôs a framework that enables organizations to:

- Operate with **federated teams** that choose their own delivery styles (Scrum, Kanban, Prince2, etc.)
- Collaborate with **AI as a direct colleague**, not just a tool
- Align through **shared principles**, not rigid processes
- Adapt quickly to **market changes and product innovation**
- Evolve through **community-driven contributions and transparency**

- **Outcome Over Output**: Focus on real-world impact, not just deliverables.
- **Inclusive Governance**: Lightweight, evidence-based coordination.
